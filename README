December 2010:
  noticed that scattered light correction wasn't being done,
  tracked down to incorrect params in eceap that were being used instead
  of those in aptap (which were correct). Still noticed scattered light
  subtraction wasn't perfect and had an impact on EWs, so added background
  subraction in apall; this failed until I hand-edited xmin,xmax in the
  database/refap file

  Also noticed CR rejection failed at least on a fainter twilight frame as
  cores of absorption features were being zapped, so added POSITIVE option
  to only zap positive fluctuations, and shrank box from 7,1 to 5,1

  Also modified script to use local uparm files, not all from the parent
  directory, in an attempt to keep those latter ones fixed
